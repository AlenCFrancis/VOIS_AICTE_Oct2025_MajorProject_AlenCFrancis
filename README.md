Netflix has become one of the most prominent global streaming platforms, continuously expanding its library with a mix of original productions and licensed content. However, with growing competition from platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney+, and regional OTT providers, Netflix must strategically analyze its content catalog to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities.  
The specific problem to be addressed in this project is 'Content Trends Analysis for Strategic Recommendations'. The aim is to uncover how Netflix’s content distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, and country contributions) has evolved over the years. This will enable the identification of key genres, audience preferences, and strategic insights into global content expansion.
